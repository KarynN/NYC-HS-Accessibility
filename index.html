                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>Our interactive map displays the distribution of commute time across census tracts in four boroughs: Manhattan, Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. We did not include Staten Island due to its restricted access to public transport and smaller population density and a few other tracts with very low population density. You can hover over any tract for the tract name, average commute in minutes, median income, and a beeswarm plot. The beeswarm plot shows the distribution of commute times from a certain tract. Each dot is a school colored according to its achievement score, and positioned according to commute time from the census tract.</p>

            <section id='SAFETY'>
                    <h2>Safety</h2>
                    <p>Our second interactive map illustrates each NYC high school as a dot colored according to Feel Safe Percentage, with size proportional to its Economic Need Index. Students&apos; perception of safety in their commutes influence their academic performance, and we believe it important to visualize the distribution of students&apos; wellbeing.</p>
                    <aside>A school's Economic Need Index measures the socioeconomic circumstances of a school's population and assigns a score to each school based on the number of students eligible for free lunch or public assistance or who live in temporary housing---a higher index indicates a higher economic need. The Feel Safe Percentage is calculated using the percentage of agree and strongly agree responses to the NYC Schools Survey prompt <em>&quot;I feel safe travelling to/from school&quot;</em></aside>
                    <p>You can click on any dot, and a pop-up will appear with the high school's name, Feel Safe percentage, and economic need index.</p>

                            <p>At a glance, our first map illustrates that Manhattan has the shortest average commutes of the four boroughs. Beyond geography, we wanted to determine any patterns between commutes, race, and socioeconomic status.</p>
                            <p>Tracts that are majority non-white have median incomes under &dollar;70,000 and commutes around 1 hour. In contrast, tracts with higher median incomes are majority white and have shorter, more consistent commute times.</p>

                    <p>Our second map illustrates that Manhattan has schools with low economic need and high Feel Safe percentages (small green dots). In contrast, The Bronx has high economic need and lower Feel Safe percentages (large red, orange, and yellow dots). As before, we wanted to see how certain demographics are clustered based on these metrics. Dots are sized according to school enrollment.</p>
                    <p>Majority white schools have higher Feel Safe percentages and low economic need, whereas majority non-white schools experience higher economic need and lower Feel Safe percentages (with high variability.)</p>

                <h2>What's next?</h2>
                <p>We believe public infrastructure ought to be consistent and equitable to effectively serve communities. Our objectives with this project (and future advancements) is to inform the public and guide policy considerations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>School choice is important, but we need to ensure school quality is consistent across the board so students and families can exercise full liberty in selecting an education.</li>
                    <li>Students&apos; economic need and safety directly influences their academic wellbeing&mdash;students shouldn&apos;t need to worry about anything other than school, at school.</li>
                    <li>Many communities depend on public transportation for education and occupation, and it&apos;s important to ensure these systems are reliable and effective for all geographies of NYC.</li>
                    <li>We&apos;d like our project to offer a more granular look into students&apos; commutes, incorporating direct enrollment data for census blocks, to further understand the pathway between students and their school.</li>
